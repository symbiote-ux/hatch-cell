Proposed Collaboration : Startup Cell Proposal: “HatchCell”
We propose the setup of a Startup Cell at Alpine Group Of Institutes with the following vision:
To enable grassroots entrepreneurship by providing MVP-stage startup cells in Indian colleges and schools, creating a builder-first ecosystem with support, mentorship, and a marketplace for startup ideas.

The Problem
95% of Indian colleges and schools lack startup infrastructure.


Existing startup support kicks in after MVP(Minimum Viable product) stage / Launch stage.


Students with ideas don’t know how to start, build, or pitch.


No structured early tech/legal/financial guidance.


No platform to sell/buy MVPs or hire within startups.


Startup culture is limited to elite institutions and metros.



Our Solution
We build on-campus startup cells providing:
*Minimum Viable product - First stage of an idea, basic prototype*
MVP-to-Launch Support
Tech support to convert ideas into MVP.

UI/UX and prototyping guidance.

Product validation.


Pitch & Business Readiness
Pitch deck preparation.

Financial projections.

Company registration, GST, Startup india registration, support in getting government aids etc.


Reverse VC Marketplace [Future integration]
Platform to buy, sell, co-build MVPs.


Connect idea creators with builders and vice versa.
Internal Startup Hiring [Future integration]
Talent sharing within the student/startup network.


Campus-to-startup hiring pipeline.
Founders’ Community [Future integration]
Pan-India builder collective.


Peer support, co-founder matching, early access to talent.


Hackathons & Events  [Future integration]
Startup-themed hackathons.


School and college entrepreneurship competitions.


Global & Sector Connects [Future integration]
International startup advisors.
Corporate innovation tie-ups (edtech, healthtech, etc.).



Implementation Model
Partner with Tier 2–3 colleges/schools.


Setup startup space with basic infra (Wi-Fi, projector).


Deploy core support team: tech, legal, finance, ops.


Online platform for tracking progress, mentor connects, and Reverse VC.


Host monthly MVP clinics + quarterly hackathons.



Our Differentiator

Focus on the “0 to MVP” stage, not post-MVP.


Only player with Reverse VC MVP Marketplace.


For builders, by builders — community-first approach.
