### ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- *Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.* If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- *Organize co de into clearly separated modules*, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- *Use clear, consistent imports* (prefer relative imports within packages).


### ðŸ§  AI Behavior Rules
- *Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.*
- *Never hallucinate libraries or functions* â€“ only use known, verified node packages.
- *Always confirm file paths and module names* exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- *Never delete or overwrite existing code* unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from TASK.md.

## Manual Testing

- Use future dates for theÂ curlÂ testing.
